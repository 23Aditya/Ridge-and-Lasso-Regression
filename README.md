# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression

L1 regularization, also known as the Lasso technique, is a method for regularizing linear models that forces the weights of the model to be sparse by adding an L1 penalty term to the cost function. This in turn encourages the model to select only a few features from the available feature set, leading to a more parsimonious model. The objective of the L1 regularization is to reduce the magnitude of the coefficients of the features, which can help reduce the complexity of the model and avoid overfitting.
